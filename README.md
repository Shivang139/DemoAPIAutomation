**Showcase your SDET prowess and cloud-based automation skills with DemoAPIAutomation – a robust and scalable Java-based framework designed for efficient REST API testing.**

This repository provides a comprehensive and well-structured framework leveraging the power of TestNG for test orchestration and LambdaTest for seamless cloud-based test execution. It's built to handle complex API testing scenarios with ease, offering features like JSON validation, parameterized testing, and detailed reporting.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Built with Java:** Ensures enterprise-level stability and a rich ecosystem of libraries.
* **TestNG Integration:** Provides a powerful and flexible framework for test management and execution.
* **LambdaTest Ready:** Easily integrate with LambdaTest for scalable and cross-browser (for API testing?) cloud execution.
* **REST API Testing:** Specifically designed for testing RESTful APIs.
* **JSON Validation:** Effortlessly validate API responses against expected JSON schemas.
* **Parameterized Tests:** Run the same test logic with different sets of data for comprehensive coverage.
* **Detailed Assertions:** Utilize TestNG's assertion capabilities for clear and informative test results.
* **CI/CD Integration:** Designed with continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines in mind.
* **Scalable and Modular:** The framework is structured for easy expansion and maintenance.
* **Clear Reporting:** Leverage TestNG's reporting features and enhance them as needed.
* **Ideal for Skill Demonstration:** Perfect for showcasing your Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) and cloud automation expertise.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to get your local environment up and running and start exploring the framework.

### Prerequisites

* **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Ensure you have Java 11 or a later version installed. You can download it from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/).
* **Maven:** This project uses Maven for dependency management and build automation. Install it from [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
* **IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse (Recommended):** While you can use any text editor, these IDEs provide excellent support for Java and Maven projects.
* **LambdaTest Account (Optional but Recommended):** Sign up for a free or paid account at [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/) to leverage cloud-based execution.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Shivang139/DemoAPIAutomation.git
    ```

2.  **Build the Project using Maven:**
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```
    This command will download all the necessary dependencies and compile the project.

### Configuration

1.  **API Endpoint Configuration:** You'll likely need to configure the base URLs and any specific endpoints for the APIs you want to test. Look for configuration files (e.g., `config.properties`, `application.properties`) within the project structure and update them accordingly.

2.  **LambdaTest Configuration (Optional):** If you intend to run tests on LambdaTest, you'll need to provide your LambdaTest username and access key. This might involve setting environment variables or configuring a specific LambdaTest configuration file. Refer to the LambdaTest documentation for detailed instructions.

## 🧪 Running the Tests

You can execute the API automation tests in several ways:

### Running Tests via Maven

To run all tests using the TestNG plugin in Maven:

```bash
mvn test
```
### Running Specific Test Suites or Tests
You can also run specific test suites or individual test classes/methods using TestNG configurations (e.g., testng.xml).
```
Bash

mvn test -Dsurefire.suiteXmlFiles=path/to/your/testng.xml
```
### Running Tests in IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse
Most IDEs provide excellent integration with TestNG. You can typically right-click on a test class or method and choose "Run" to execute it.

### Running Tests on LambdaTest (If Configured)
If you have configured LambdaTest, your Maven configuration might be set up to automatically run tests on the LambdaTest grid. Consult your project's pom.xml and LambdaTest documentation for specific execution commands.
